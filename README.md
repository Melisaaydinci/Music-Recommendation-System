# Music Recommendation System

This repository contains two types of recommendation systems for suggesting songs: popularity-based and user-based.

## Popularity-based Recommendation System

The popularity-based recommendation system suggests songs based on their overall popularity among all users. It recommends popular songs that have been liked or listened to by many users.

## User-based Recommendation System

The user-based recommendation system suggests songs based on the preferences and behavior of individual users. It analyzes the listening history and preferences of each user to recommend songs that are similar to the ones they have liked or listened to before.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Melisaaydinci/Music-Recommendation-System.git

##I will deploy this recommendation system model in my Musicfy project
